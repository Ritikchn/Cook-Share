    steps: [
      "Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.",
      "Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside. Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.",
      "After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water or as required.",
      "Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste in a bowl and set aside.",
      "In the same blender add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.",
      "Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.",
      "Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the flame to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons butter OR 1 tablespoon oil + 1 or 2 tbsp butter in a pan.",
      "Keep the flame to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf). Fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil becomes fragrant from the aroma of the tej patta.",
      "Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready ginger-garlic paste.",
      "Fry for some seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears.",
      "Pour the prepared tomato puree. Be careful while adding the puree as it may splutter.",
      "Mix it very well with the butter.",
      "Begin to cook the tomato puree on a low to medium-low flame. Stir at intervals.",
      "The tomato puree mixture will start simmering.",
      "In case the tomato puree splutters too much while cooking then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter lid (channi lid). the tomato puree might splutter if there is more water content in the tomatoes.",
      "Do stir at intervals.",
      "Simmer the puree for 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "Then add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch. You can even add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or ¼ to ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper or paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder.",
      "Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato puree.",
      "Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato puree mixture comes together as a whole.",
      "Now add the prepared cashew paste.",
      "Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low flame. Stir non-stop after adding cashew paste.",
      "Sauté till the cashew paste is cooked and again the oil will start to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low flame. So keep on stirring non-stop.",
      "Next add 1.5 cups water.",
      "Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew makhani masala. If there are lumps of the tomato-cashew masala, then break with a spoon. You can even use a wired whisk for mixing.",
      "Let the curry simmer and come to a boil. Stir occasionally.",
      "After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger – cut in julienne (thin matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.",
      "After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chillies.",
      "Also add salt as per taste and ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional). You can add sugar from ¼ tsp to 1 teaspoon or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.",
      "Mix very well and simmer for a minute.",
      "After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).",
      "Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.",
      "Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi leaves (dry fenugreek leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy",
      "Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.",
      "Stir gently but well and switch off the heat.",
      "Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving.",

    steps: [
      "Rinse 1 cup dried white chickpeas (a.k.a. chana or chole) in fresh water a couple of times. Then soak them overnight or for 8 to 9 hours in 3 cups of wate",
      "Traditionally dried amla (Indian gooseberries) are added to impart a dark color to the chickpeas. Amla also gives a faint sourness to the stock. If you do not have dried amla, you can opt to add 1 black tea bag.",
      "In a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker, add the chickpeas along with 2 to 3 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Add 2.5 to 3 cups of water.",
      "Season with ½ teaspoon salt. Stir very well.",
      "Pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles on medium heat. The chickpeas should be cooked well and softened enough that you can mash them with a spoon.",
      "Meanwhile, add all the whole spices for the chole masala to a pan or skillet. Begin to roast them on a low heat.",
      "Stir often and roast the spices until they get extra browned, but not yet burnt. Don’t stop even after they become fragrant, as they need to get more browned than usual.",
      "The extra browned and roasted spices are pictured below.",
      "Let these roasted spices cool and then grind or powder them finely in a coffee grinder or in a dry grinder.",
      " By now the chickpeas are cooked (pictured below). You will see a darker brown shade in the white chickpeas. Remove the amla pieces or the tea bag from the stock and discard them.",
      "Heat 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan or kadai (wok). Add ½ teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds or until their raw aroma goes away. You can use any neutral tasting oil.",
      "Then add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions. Sauté stirring often till the onions soften and turn translucent or light brown.",
      " Add ½ cup finely chopped tomatoes.",
      "Sauté the tomatoes stirring often until they soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the onion-tomato mixture.",
      "Reduce the heat. Then add all of the powdered spices that we made, together with ½ teaspoon red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.",
      "Mix very well. Then add 2 to 3 slit green chilies to the onion-tomato masala mixture.",
      "Add the cooked and drained chickpeas. Reserve the stock.",
      "Stir and mix very well.",
      "Season with salt as per requirement. Mix again. Keep the addition of salt in check as salt is also there in the stock.",
      "Add about 1 to 1.25 cups of reserved stock or water. Stir well.",
      "For a thinner gravy, cover and simmer on low to medium heat. You can also cook chickpeas without the lid, causing the gravy to thicken and reduce.",
      "If you have not added dry pomegranate seeds while roasting the spices, then you need to add amchur powder (dry mango powder) now.",
      "The chana masala is ready to be served.",
      "Garnish with chopped onions and cilantro (coriander leaves). Serve the Punjabi chole with fried Indian bread like bhatura or poori, together with a side of sliced onions, ginger julienne and lime or lemon wedges. Yum!",
